import Foundation

/// Why a request was refused, and therefore what the device should do about it.

/// Four conditions arrive over two status codes, and the status alone does not
/// separate them. All four were measured against a live scoped, capped project
/// on 2026-09-16 rather than read off documentation — the bodies below are
/// verbatim.
///
/// | Status | `type` / `code`                                  | Case          |
/// |--------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|
/// | 401/403| `invalid_api_key` and friends                    | `.rejected`   |
/// | 403    | `invalid_request_error` / `model_not_found`      | `.capability` |
/// | 429    | `insufficient_quota` / `project_spend_limit_…`   | `.exhausted`  |
/// | 429    | `rate_limit_exceeded`                            | `.transient`  |
///
/// The two defaults are deliberately asymmetric, and both preserve the
/// behaviour that existed before this type:
///
/// - An **unrecognised 403 is `.rejected`**. A refusal to authenticate is the
///   overwhelmingly likely reading, and a device that wrongly falls back still
///   speaks every word the child taps.
/// - An **unrecognised 429 is `.transient`**. Ordinary rate limiting is far more
///   common than quota exhaustion, and condemning a working key over a burst is
///   exactly the failure `SentenceEngine.isKeyRejection` was written to avoid.
