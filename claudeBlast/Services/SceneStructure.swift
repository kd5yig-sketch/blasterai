//
//  Structure — the pages and core words a caregiver adds to a scene — resolved
//  in one place, for every surface that offers it.
//
//  ## Why this exists
//
//  A generated scene used to arrive pre-wrapped in a core cluster and four
//  category pages, and the only control over that was a "Focused board" toggle
//  that rebuilt the scene from its home-page words — silently dropping every
//  page the caregiver had made. There was no way to ask for a *different*
//  structure, only more or less of ours.
//
//  So structure became a step you walk through rather than a flag you set.
//  Creation produces a flat page of the words the scene is about; pages and core
//  words are chosen afterwards, explicitly, by the person who knows what the
//  child needs. `SceneStructurePlan` is that choice, and `SceneStructure.build`
//  turns it into pages.
//
//  ## Additive by construction
//
//  `build` only ever produces *new* pages and *new* home-page tiles. It reads the
//  scene's existing page keys and home-page tiles so it can skip what is already
//  there and uniquify what isn't, but it never rewrites, reorders or removes
//  anything. That is what makes the step safe to re-enter on a scene someone has
//  spent an afternoon on — the property the old toggle lacked.
//
//  ## Side effects, and why they are acceptable
//
//  Building a pack page installs that pack's words, and every new page mints its
//  `page_link` tile. Both land in the device's vocabulary immediately, before the
//  scene is accepted. That is deliberate: a pack's words are vocabulary the
//  family now has rather than scene content, so backing out of the wizard
//  afterwards leaves extra words available — never a broken scene. It is also
//  what lets the confirm step render the new pages as real tiles instead of
//  placeholders.
//
