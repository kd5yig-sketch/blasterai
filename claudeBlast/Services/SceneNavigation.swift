//  Deterministic structure for AI-generated scenes.
//
//  A generated scene is the child's FAMILIAR core board with today's topical
//  vocabulary laid on top — not a novel layout. The model contributes only the
//  topical world (the inferred animals/objects/places for the activity); this
//  file supplies everything the child already knows from the built-in Core-First
//  scene so the scene feels the same:
//
//  - the home page leads with the topical tiles, then carries a curated core
//    cluster (pronouns, family, hungry/thirsty, eat→food, drink→drinks, help,
//    feelings, yes/no/more/…) and links to the familiar category pages; and
//  - a small set of rich category pages — people, food, drinks, body & health —
//    is bundled in, built by word class exactly as Core-First builds them
//    (Resources/scenes/core_first.json), including the food↔drinks cross-links.
//
//  The model's own page structure is discarded entirely: it is unreliable, and
//  the value here is consistency with the board the child uses every day.

    /// generated scene impossible to reason about: you could not tell what the

    /// made yourself. Now nothing is added unless someone asks for it, and what
    /// they asked for is visible in the sheet that asked.
