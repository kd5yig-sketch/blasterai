"""List every OpenAI model the app calls, so a project allowlist can't miss one.

    Usage:
        python3 tools/audit_openai_models.py          # list, and check for drift
        python3 tools/audit_openai_models.py --quiet  # exit code only

Why this exists
---------------
Gifted evaluator keys live in an OpenAI project with a **model allowlist**, and a
model the code calls but the project does not permit fails with a 403
`model_not_found`. That is survivable for art — the caregiver is told, and the
key is not condemned — but it is not survivable for `omni-moderation-latest`:
tier 2 of word moderation would stop running while the app kept working, and a
tier-3 verdict would still come back, so nothing anywhere would look wrong. A
child-safety layer would be off and silent.

So before minting keys, the allowlist has to be checked against what the code
actually calls, and that list has to come from the code rather than from memory.

`ModelID` in claudeBlast/Services/OpenAI/ModelPricing.swift says it is "the one
place model ids are written down". It is not, quite: several services still
inline their own string literal. That is exactly the drift this catches — a new
service added with a new model would be invisible until an evaluator hit it.

Exits non-zero when a model literal appears in the sources without a matching
`ModelID` constant.
