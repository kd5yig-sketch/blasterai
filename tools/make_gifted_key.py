"""Wrap an OpenAI key into a .blasterkey file an evaluator can tap to install.

The problem this solves is not typing. An evaluator could make their own key;
what stops them is being asked to put a credit card down to try a favour someone
asked them to look at. So the key is ours, and it arrives as a file.

    Usage:
        python3 tools/make_gifted_key.py --for Brandi
        python3 tools/make_gifted_key.py --for Brandi --out ~/Desktop
        python3 tools/make_gifted_key.py --for Brandi --expires 2026-12-31
        python3 tools/make_gifted_key.py --for Brandi --key sk-...   # scripting only

    Produces:  Brandi.blasterkey

The key is read from a prompt by default, and that is deliberate: a key passed as
--key lands in your shell history, where it outlives the evaluator. Pasting into
the prompt is the same gesture and leaves nothing behind. --key stays for
scripting.

THE WHOLE LOOP, including the parts no script can do
----------------------------------------------------
1. platform.openai.com, project **Blaster TestFlight** (not your default project,
   which is development spend and should stay separate).
2. Create a secret key and **name it after the evaluator**. The name is the whole
   ledger: the dashboard shows name, monthly spend and last-used per key, which
   answers "this key is burning money — whose is it?" without anything being
   written down here. Nothing in this repo records keys, and nothing should.
3. Confirm the project allows all three models the app calls: `gpt-4o-mini`,
   `omni-moderation-latest`, `gpt-image-1`. Withholding the moderation model
   silently removes a child-safety tier — the app keeps working and words stop
   being checked. `tools/audit_openai_models.py` lists what the code calls.
4. Run this script. Text the file.
5. To revoke: delete the key in the dashboard. That is the only revocation that
   works; nothing in the file or the app can take a key back.

A note on the spending limit: it enforces, but it lags. Measured 2026-09-16,
spend reached $1.44 against a $1 limit before the first refusal, so treat a cap
as a backstop with alerts rather than a fence. Images are essentially the entire
spend (~4.8c each; sentences need ~34,000 generations to reach a dollar), so a
cap is in practice a cap on art.

OBFUSCATION, NOT ENCRYPTION
---------------------------
The file is scrambled with a keystream derived from the app's bundle identifier,
which is public. This stops a casual reader and keeps the key out of `sk-`
pattern scanners and out of the evaluator's own hands in usable form. It stops
nobody who tries. That is the intended trade — see the long note in
`claudeBlast/Services/GiftedKeyTransfer.swift`, and do not "upgrade" one side
without the other.
